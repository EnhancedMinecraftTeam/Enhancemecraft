Enhancemecraft Modification for Minecraft Forge

EnhanceMeCraft Crusader's Pack ver. 0.4.0

priority 1: New Biomes

priority 2: Hypothermia/thirst bar

priority 3: new Mobs

priority 4: Revamp Nether

priority 5: Snowgate

Priority 1: New Biomes. This will probably go in the mod with all the mobs, as the spawn of some of these mobs is in these biomes. I gave a list to Lexicon and sparta, and here is that list:

1. Red rock mountains and canyons/ like Nevada(all the stone is red cobble, smeltable Into red rock, no trees, but there are spires and mountains, canyons, and rivers, everywhere. It has dead brush all around.)

2. Icy Desert( frozen mountains, made of ice and frozen stone, mined for frozen cobble, smelted to make smooth stone, if combined with snowballs, it makes frozen stone.)

3. Redwood forests(super tall trees, reach a hundred of blocks high, and all of the trees are at least 9x9 blocks thick. The wood can make red sticks, signs, wood blocks, doors, stairs, and slabs.)

4. Oasis(there is sand, and palm trees. They drop coconuts, and dates, and have a water pool in the center.)

5. Volcanic(there is lava everywhere, in little pools, and obsidian, dirt, and obsidian/cobble mountains raising high. Maybe a game dynamic that launches fire charges into the air at random and lava charges, that hit the ground and spout lava. TNT is planted in the ground, exploding at random, and these biomes are dangerous as the nether, because nether mobs spawn there.)

6. City(the villages take up their own biome. They have brick walls all around, inner and outer, with guard posts and a bunch of houses inside. Nearly every house has a chest with random loots, and streets, have an actual correlation, and don't just run around, randomly. Beneath the city, there is a dungeon, filled with zombies, all in cages.)

7. Wheat fields(not hard, but its wheat as far as the eye can see.)

8. Savanna(there is pale dirt, and no grass blocks, but grass and dead bush grow there. There is some red rock, a few savanna style trees, dusty dirt mountains with of ledges, like lion king, there are water pools, but very few, and not too common.

9. Floating islands(there is no ground, just islands with bridges, here and there, like an ethereal garden, all but abandoned, with pink trees, and food, and water falls of the edge, and the center island has a small hut.)

10. Radiation zone(basically, its a city, but the walls are crumbled, there's fire everywhere, the dungeon is open, and zombies roam around. There are villagers all underground, and the houses are burned and destroyed.)

11. Subway tunnels(Often found out In a village, beneath the dungeon, these rail tracks run underground to other destinations, like jungle temples, and other naturally spawning buildings. They go automatically on a loop.)

12. Fairie Forest(A forest of tall trees, that blot out the sun. But there are little shrubs, and Torres and streams, and little balls, like experience orbs, but blue, whiz around the forest. Occasionally, you come across fairie huts, or circles in the ground.

that is the biomes priority, but now, the second priority was hypothermia and thirst bar. This will also most likely be in the mob mod, because the animals change how you adapt to these different things.

on the bottom right of your screen, you could have a bar, made of water buckets, and over a three day time period, your thirst would slowly deplete to zero, and after a while, you'd stop being able to sprint, and then, even afterwards, you'd get nausea and then start to lose health. Still, maybe you could make buckets out of wood and clay jugs, just a thought, and wood does not hold water long, and clay can hold water, but not lava.

and Maybe, on the right side of your screen, there could be a vertical bar that goes to ten, and five is normal heat and cold. But in the nether, a volcano biome, regular fire, or a desert, your heat bar goes up, and you deplete your thirst faster. However, in a frosty place like snowgate, or the icy desert, or the snow biome, you have a cold strike, and from this, everything becomes slower, or less, like, eating takes more time, and gives you less, as does thirst, you get less experience, you move slower, mine slower, can't run, and your vision becomes dim. Eventually, you start losing life, and just die.

Now, how would mobs come into play? some mobs drop pelts, which I think you can incorporate into your armor to make fur armor, and warm you up, or you make a straw hat out of haybail, you know, simple things like that.


Now, the third priority is more mobs. I formulated a list of sixty possible ideas, and I will weed it out, as that amount of mobs is really heavyweight, here is a list.

-Passive

1. rabbits(they run around your world, and are tameable with carrots. They can sit on you head and give you jump and speed boosts)

2. rat(These things just lurk in caves and dungeons. they drop pelts)

3. moose(Moose will attack if motivated, but they mainly trudge around snow biomes and icy deserts, and anywhere there's snow. They drop antlers and pelts)

.4 Giraffe(These animals have extendable necks and walk around savanna and are ride-able, but you can also climb their necks.)

.5 Elephants. (These animals have an insane amount of health, and are hard to kill. If you hit one, they all go into flurry, and if they hit you, they have knockback . They trudge around the savanna in groups, and if you do kill one, their bones will drop, and you can plant them as an elephant marker, where all the elephants will revolve. you can ride them, give them armor, and chests, and they give you a longer arm reach and knockback.)

.6 whales(These dudes swim around. No big)

.7 visible fish (replace invisible fish with real fish. four kinds. Salmon, tuna, hostile piranhas, and sardine)

.8 Sardines(Can be cooked for specific food.)

5. Alligator/ Crocodile(They are in swamps and will swim after you. They are super fast in the water, but you can easily outrun them on land. They drop scales.)

7. Tigers(Just like lions, but bigger, and they deal one whole heart of damage at a time)

8. Bears(They wont mess with you, unless you mess with them, then, they will attack you with two hearts of damage. Polar bears will attack you provoked or not, but you can put a saddle on them, and ride them through arctic biomes like a speedster, with controls like a horse.

20. Herobrine Cultists(These small groups look all like herobrine, and carry staffs that drop lightning. They are easy to kill, and drop herobrine eyes, which give you night vision if worn.

21. Sharks(They will attack you unconditionally.)

22. Atlantean Guards(They will spawn underwater, can drag you underwater, and will only attack if you hit an Atlantean.

30. Haunted Armor(This stuff will show up, and attack you. if you kill a zombie or skeleton wearing armor, their armor comes after you, and will find you and kill you.)

​ Obviously, that amount of mobs is huge, but these were all the ideas I just jotted down. They are hostile and no, and I thought you guys should see.

The fourth priority is that we revamp the Nether, and I think that we could add nether livestock, and magma dogs, also differentiate the landscape with biomes? like mountains and deserts, made all of soulsand. and netherdirt and netherrack, and maybe nether crops? Just thoughts.

the fifth priority right now, is Snowgate, and I thought it would be like an ice age overworld. maybe the water drops your hypothermia bar down very fast, and the banks are icy, mountains are impossible to scale because of the sliding, and when snow falls, it builds up. Maybe to replace villagers, we'd have cavemen? And instead of elephants, wooly mammoths? Instead of tigers and lions, sabre tooth tigers? Instead of bears, bigger bears? Maybe snowy caves with igloos, and Husky wolves. Caribou and polar bears, and rats, and monsters, and everything is frosted, like frozen trees, maybe icerot wood, they'd be called. and the stone is frosty stone, and there are streams. Snowgate should be a frozen land, not wasteland, like a world exists, but it is a much more crude world.

​These are the beginning ideas, and prepare for 0.4.0
